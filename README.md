# NavSwiss-ESP32-MPU6050
This project uses an ESP32 WROOM-32 to read real-time orientation data from two MPU6050 sensors and stream it to a browser using WebSockets. A responsive 3D model (Three.js) visualizes both sensors' rotation live in the browser.  Designed for healthcare, motion tracking, VR/AR, IoT dashboards, and multi-IMU experiments.
